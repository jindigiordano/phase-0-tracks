# WEB SERVERS

# Design philosophies of Linux OS
* Assume the user know's what they're doing, give them full access to the computer, unlike other OS that restrict access for fear people will cause problems with computer.

# VPS
* A VPS is a piece of memory that, although not it's own physical computer, can run an OS and act like it's own separate computer.
* Advantages over using a hosting provider are that you have a lot more control, and it is less expensive.

# Why not to log in to Linux as root
* It protects you from making changes to system files
* Protects from malicious files
