# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is saving a project at different stages of completion. It's useful for if something goes wrong or if you change your mind about a feature, you have backup copies to go back to, and you don't lose the original.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a continuation of the original project that further develops another feature or goes in another direction. Changes to a feature branch are independent from the master so you would use one to keep the integrity of the original until the new feature is completely finished.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a savepoint where you save your work and update your progress. A good commit message is short yet precise and descriptive.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when the contents of two branches that are attempting to merge are incompatible with one another. Git will notify you of a merge conflict so you can reseolve it.
